## About of app


I made a small application with React Native by fetching data from poke api with axios.
It consists of two pages. I brought the features of pokemon from api in Pokemon Screen. Pressing the Pokemon pictures switches to the Pokemon Detail Screen. I created this build with Stack Navigation. I sent the data I received in Pokemon Screen to Pokemon Detail Screen and used it here as well.

I also used Git version control system while developing this project. I learned its commands and concepts.
